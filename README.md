# Downloading Instructions (Linux and Mac)
Unaffortunatelly, I have not tested (and have no idea) how to download this on this OS. If you would like to contribute, you can make a PR and I can merge it.

Also, if you know how to make an executable on Linux and/or Mac, please let me know **@icky#2264**. Thank you!

# How to use it
First, go to the run you want to retime, this video has to be in Google Drive or in Youtube

Right click the video and click `Stats for nerds`

After that you will see a box that comes up in the top left corner of the video, you will look `Current / Optimal Res` section and look for the `@`. Place the numbers after the `@` in the `Framerate` text box of the retimer.

For example, if it says `1920x1080@30` your gonna put `30` on the `Framerate` text box of the retimer.

After that, go to the first framee where the runs starts, right click the video and press `Copy debug info`. And copy it on the `Start` text box of the retimer.

**Reminder you CAN'T put individual numbers, you have to paste the debug info, so you cant put numbers, only the debug info**
